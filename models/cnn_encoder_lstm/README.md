This folder contains the files that have been produced in the training of the CNN-encoder + LSTM model.

Here are the details of the files used:

1. `cnn_encoder_lstm_loss.png`: Loss diagram.
1. `cnn_encoder_lstm.png`: Backpropagation diagram of the model.
1. `cnn_encoder_lstm.py`: Model architecture.
1. `loss.py`: Code to generate the loss curves.
1. `model_arch.ipynb`: Code to generate model architecure.
1. `predictions_cnn_split_lstm.csv`: Predictions on test set.
1. `progress.csv`: Training progress.
1. `test_specific.py`: Test a specific set of models.
1. `train_specific_specific.py`: Train a specific CNN and LSTM.
