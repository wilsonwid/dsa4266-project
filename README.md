# dsa4266-project

Repository for DSA4266 project.

## Setup

1. Install [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/):

   ```shell
   pip install pipenv
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

   ```shell
   pipenv install --dev
   ```

3. Adding dependencies:

   If you need to add a new dependency, use the following command:

   ```shell
   pipenv install <package-name>
   ```

   - Do not add the package directly to the `Pipfile`. The `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` should be generated by `pipenv`.
   - You can specify if the package is a development dependency by adding the `--dev` flag.
   - Remember to commit the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` after adding a new dependency.

# Project description

This project aims to use different models in order to predict whether a given video is a deepfake. In this project, we use
several different models, such as the Recurrent-CNN and the Vision Transformer, in order to achieve the aforementioned goal.
